# DecideViz

Online debate tools in participatory democracy and crowdsourcing legislation remains limited by several factors. One of them arises when discussion of proposals reach a large number of contributions and therefore citizens encounter 
difficulties in mapping the arguments that constitute the dialectical debate. 

To address this issue, this visualization tool that shows the discussion of a debate/proposal as an interactive radial tree. The tool builds on a recently created platform for open consultation and direct democracy called *[Decide Madrid](https://decide.madrid.es/)* launched by the City Council of Madrid.
